### **External previews**

A json object that contains the external preview settings, It is defined as

```typescript
interface {
  [extensions: string]: {
    [name: string]: string //(url)
  }
}
```

the first key `extensions` is the file extensions that split by `,`(if it's startsWith `/`, it will be considered a regular expression), and the value is also a `key-value` object, the key is the preview name, and the value is the external url.

For the external url, we provide some variables for you to use:

Basic variable:

- `$url`: the file url
- `$durl`: the file of alist URL
- `$name`: the file name

Extended variables:
Add [eb_] before the basic variable, where e means `encodeURIComponent`, b means `base64`, such as
- `$e_url`: encodeURIComponent($url)
- `$b_url`: btoa($url)
- `$eb_url`: encodeURIComponent(btoa($url))

Finally, the `External previews` will displayed a `Open with` menu while current file matched the `extensions`.

For example, set `External previews` to

```json
{
  "txt": {
    "Notepad": "notepad://$url"
  },
  "/.*/": {
    "VSCode": "vscode://$url"
  }
}
```

when we enter a file with the extension `txt`, it will show:

![Open-with](/img/config/open-with.png)

### **Iframe previews**

Similar to `External previews`, but it will embed an iframe in current page directly.
