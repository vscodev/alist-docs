### **Cookie**

Just find a parameter carrying Cookie in the F12 request and copy it

- It is recommended to use the Cookie parameter in the request refreshed later, which will carry the Cookie containing the **`tf_x`** parameter.

- `login`、`DescribeTasks`、`DescribeAccount`、`DescribeUserProfile`、`DescribePlatformSettings`、`CreateBindWechatQRCode`

The cookies that can be used are those that need to carry the **`tf_x`** parameter. In the example in the figure, the one on the left can be used, but the one on the right cannot be used.
